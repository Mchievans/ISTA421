 1.  What does the ASP.NET Core routing system do?
 It handles incoming requests from clients, but it also generates outgoing URLs that conform to the URL scheme and that can be embedded in web pages. It makes al the URLS consistent. The IUrlHelper interface is the tool for this. 

 2. What is a Class that provides a small amount of reusable application logic with the ability to select and display Razor partial views? A view component.
 A view component is similar to a partial view but doesn't use model binding but relies on whatever you pass it. Intended for use in cases where you have reusable rendering logic too complex for a partial view.
  
 3. Why do you not have to manage the storage or life cycle of the Cart objects? 
 The ASP.NET session state which associates data with a session.  Data associated with a session is deleted when a session expires.

 When a URL needs to be returned along with a query. for instance a URL with a date so, 
 URL.com/thisLink/Date=today

 5. What property of the View component provides information about how the request URL was handled by the routing system? The RouteData property.
