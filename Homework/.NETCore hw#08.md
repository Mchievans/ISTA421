            app.UseMvc(routes => {  });

2. What interface allows a collection of objects to be queried efficiently?
The IQueryable<T> interface allows you to quey database for just the objects required using LINQ statements. 

3. What does the @model represent at the top of a view?
It specifies that the view will receive objects from the action method as its model data.

4. Why are connection strings important and how are they stored?
A connection string specifies the location and name of the database and provides configuration settings for how the application should connect to the database server. They are stored in a JSON file. 
 
5. What is a composable URL and how do you create one using MVC?
A composable URL is one that makes sense to the user. Add a new route in the startup class in the app.USEMVC() extension method. This defines the name, template format and the default return when called.
